# PRD: BookForge - AI-Powered Book Generation Desktop Application

## Introduction/Overview

Content creators, educators, and authors struggle with the time-intensive process of writing comprehensive books. Existing solutions either require technical expertise or lack the flexibility to work with multiple AI providers. BookForge addresses this by providing a user-friendly desktop application that leverages various AI models to generate complete, well-structured books from simple prompts.

**Goal:** Enable non-technical users to generate high-quality books using AI, with complete control over the generation process, export formats, and cost management.

## Goals

1. Democratize book creation by reducing time from idea to complete manuscript by 90%
2. Support multiple AI providers to give users flexibility in model selection and cost optimization
3. Provide real-time cost tracking to prevent unexpected API charges
4. Enable offline-capable generation with local models through Ollama
5. Deliver professional-quality output in multiple formats suitable for publishing

## User Stories

1. **As an educator**, I want to quickly generate educational materials tailored to my curriculum so that I can focus on teaching rather than content creation.

2. **As a self-publishing author**, I want to create book drafts using AI assistance so that I can overcome writer's block and accelerate my publishing schedule.

3. **As a content creator**, I want to generate long-form content with consistent tone and style so that I can maintain quality across multiple projects.

4. **As a budget-conscious user**, I want to track token usage and costs in real-time so that I can manage my AI spending effectively.

5. **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want to use local AI models so that my content never leaves my computer.

6. **As a non-technical user**, I want a simple interface that doesn't require coding knowledge so that I can focus on my creative process.

### Development Tools
- **Code signing certificates:** For platform distribution
- **CI/CD pipeline:** For automated builds
- **Testing infrastructure:** For quality assurance

## Timeline & Priority

- **Priority:** High (MVP needed for market validation)
- **Total Timeline:** 9 weeks to public release

### Phase Breakdown
- **Week 1:** Foundation and project setup
- **Week 2-3:** Core architecture and provider system
- **Week 3-4:** User interface development
- **Week 4-5:** Book generation engine
- **Week 5-6:** Export system implementation
- **Week 6-7:** Polish and distribution setup
- **Week 8:** Beta testing and bug fixes
- **Week 9:** Public release preparation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **API rate limiting causing generation interruptions** - *Mitigation: Implement retry logic and provider switching*
- **Large book generation causing memory issues** - *Mitigation: Streaming architecture and chunked processing*
- **Cross-platform compatibility issues** - *Mitigation: Extensive testing on all platforms*

### Business Risks
- **AI provider pricing changes** - *Mitigation: Support multiple providers for flexibility*
- **Generated content quality concerns** - *Mitigation: Two-phase generation and quality prompts*
- **Competition from web-based solutions** - *Mitigation: Focus on privacy and offline capabilities*

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity overwhelming non-technical users** - *Mitigation: Progressive disclosure and sensible defaults*
- **Long generation times frustrating users** - *Mitigation: Progress indicators and time estimates*

## Accessibility Requirements

- All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable
- Screen reader support for all UI components
- High contrast mode support
- Customizable font sizes for reading comfort
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Alternative text for all icons and images

## Design Considerations

- Consistent with modern desktop application patterns
- Clean, minimalist interface to reduce cognitive load
- Clear visual hierarchy for generation options
- Real-time feedback for all user actions
- Progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Responsive layout adapting to window size

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Electron main/renderer process separation for security

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a freemium model with limited monthly generations?
2. What should be the default book length limits to prevent excessive costs?
3. Should we add watermarks to books generated with free tier?
4. How should we handle inappropriate content generation requests?
5. Should we implement book templates for common genres?
6. What level of customization should HTML/PDF exports support?
7. Should we track anonymous usage analytics for improvement?
