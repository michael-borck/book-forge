# BookForge Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to implementing BookForge based on the task list. Each phase includes quality checkpoints and specific implementation details.

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Incremental Progress**: Complete one feature fully before moving to the next
3. **Security First**: Implement security measures from the start
4. **Performance Awareness**: Profile and optimize as you build
5. **User-Centric Design**: Test with real users frequently

## Phase 1: Foundation and Setup (Week 1)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Create project structure
npx create-electron-app book-forge --template=typescript
cd book-forge

# Set up Next.js in renderer
npx create-next-app@latest src/renderer --typescript --tailwind --app --no-src-dir

# Install core dependencies
pnpm add electron-builder electron-updater
pnpm add @anthropic-ai/sdk openai @google/generative-ai
pnpm add zustand @tanstack/react-query
pnpm add -D @types/node jest @testing-library/react playwright
```

### Task 1.1: Initialize Electron + Next.js
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Configure electron-builder in package.json
2. Set up main process entry point with TypeScript
3. Configure Next.js for Electron renderer
4. Enable hot reload for development

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] App launches in development mode
- [ ] Hot reload works for both main and renderer
- [ ] No console errors on startup
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

### Task 1.2-1.5: Configuration and Setup
**Key Files to Create:**
```
book-forge/
├── .eslintrc.js
├── .prettierrc
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   └── preload.ts
│   └── renderer/
│       └── (Next.js app structure)
```

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] ESLint passes without errors
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- [ ] IPC communication test passes
- [ ] shadcn/ui Button component renders

## Phase 2: Core Architecture (Week 2-3)

### Task 2.1-2.2: Provider System Foundation
**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
// src/shared/types/provider.ts
export interface IProvider {
  name: string;
  initialize(config: ProviderConfig): Promise<void>;
  generateStream(params: GenerationParams): AsyncGenerator<GenerationChunk>;
  countTokens(text: string): Promise<number>;
  estimateCost(usage: TokenUsage): CostEstimate;
  getAvailableModels(): Promise<Model[]>;
}

// src/main/services/providers/BaseProvider.ts
export abstract class BaseProvider implements IProvider {
  protected config: ProviderConfig;
  abstract name: string;
  
  async initialize(config: ProviderConfig): Promise<void> {
    this.config = config;
    await this.validateConfig();
  }
  
  protected abstract validateConfig(): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All provider interfaces defined with JSDoc
- [ ] BaseProvider passes unit tests
- [ ] Type checking passes for all providers
- [ ] Mock provider works end-to-end

### Task 2.3-2.7: Provider Implementations
**Testing Each Provider:**
```bash
# Test individual providers
pnpm test src/main/services/providers/GroqProvider.test.ts
pnpm test src/main/services/providers/ClaudeProvider.test.ts
# ... etc

# Integration test with mock API
pnpm test:integration providers
```

**Quality Checkpoint per Provider:**
- [ ] Connects to API successfully
- [ ] Handles rate limiting gracefully
- [ ] Streams content without interruption
- [ ] Token counting accuracy >95%
- [ ] Cost calculation matches provider pricing
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Task 3.0: Security Implementation
**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] API keys never logged or exposed
- [ ] IPC calls validate all input
- [ ] No eval() or dynamic code execution
- [ ] CSP headers configured properly
- [ ] Electron security best practices followed

**Test Security:**
```bash
# Run security audit
pnpm audit
pnpm test:security

# Manual penetration testing checklist
- Try injecting scripts via book topic
- Attempt to access main process from renderer
- Try to read API keys from DevTools
```

## Phase 3: User Interface (Week 3-4)

### Task 5.0-6.0: Core UI Components
**Component Development Workflow:**
1. Create component with TypeScript interface
2. Add Storybook story for isolated testing
3. Write unit tests with React Testing Library
4. Implement accessibility features
5. Add to main application

**Quality Checkpoint per Component:**
- [ ] Renders in all supported themes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader announces correctly
- [ ] No accessibility warnings
- [ ] Responsive from 1024px to 4K

### Task 7.0-8.0: Generation Interface
**Complex Component Testing:**
```typescript
// Example test for generation interface
describe('BookGenerator', () => {
  it('should estimate cost before generation', async () => {
    render(<BookGenerator />);
    
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText('Topic'), 'Machine Learning');
    await userEvent.selectOptions(screen.getByLabelText('Provider'), 'groq');
    
    expect(screen.getByText(/Estimated cost:/)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/\$0.\d{2}/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] Loading states show during async operations
- [ ] Error states have recovery actions
- [ ] Progress indicators accurate to ±5%

# Memory profiling
pnpm test:memory --profile generation
```

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Generates 10-chapter book without errors
- [ ] Handles provider disconnection gracefully
- [ ] Resumes from last checkpoint after crash
- [ ] Context remains consistent across chapters

- Linux: AppImage, Snap, Flatpak permissions
```

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Installers under 150MB
- [ ] Auto-update works on all platforms
- [ ] No antivirus false positives
- [ ] App launches in <5 seconds
- [ ] Proper file associations set

## Phase 7: Quality Assurance (Week 8)

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests: >90% code coverage
- Integration tests: All critical paths
- E2E tests: 20 user scenarios
- Performance tests: Meet all targets
- Security tests: Pass OWASP checklist

**Beta Testing Process:**
1. Deploy to 50+ beta testers
2. Set up crash reporting
3. Create feedback collection system
4. Daily bug triage meetings
5. Fix all P0/P1 issues before release

## Phase 8: Release (Week 9)

### Release Checklist

**Pre-Release:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Marketing website live
- [ ] Support system ready
- [ ] Analytics configured

**Release Day:**
- [ ] Upload to GitHub Releases
- [ ] Publish to package managers
- [ ] Send announcement emails
- [ ] Post on social media
- [ ] Monitor crash reports

**Post-Release:**
- [ ] Respond to user feedback
- [ ] Fix critical bugs immediately
- [ ] Plan next version features
- [ ] Write retrospective

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Crash rate: <0.1%
- User retention: >60% after 30 days
- Generation success rate: >95%
- Average session length: >20 minutes
- Support ticket rate: <5%

### Feedback Loops
1. Weekly user interviews
2. A/B testing for new features
3. Performance regression tests
4. Security audits quarterly
5. Accessibility audits monthly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Memory Leaks**: Always cleanup event listeners and subscriptions
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff
3. **Large Files**: Stream everything, never load fully into memory
4. **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on minimum supported OS versions
5. **Security**: Never trust user input, validate everything

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered successful when:
- All tasks marked complete in TASK_LIST.md
- All quality checkpoints passed
- Beta user satisfaction >4.5/5
- Performance targets met
- Security audit passed
- Documentation complete

Remember: Quality over speed. A polished MVP is better than a buggy full release.
